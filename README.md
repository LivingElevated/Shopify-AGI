The GitHub link and toolkit name are stored in a superagi/tools/tools.json like this:
{ "toolkit-name": "YOUR-GITHUB-LINK" }
Step 4: Re-build SuperAGI Using Docker and Start Using Your Tools

Once the linking is completed, you have to restart your docker.

Run the following command in the terminal:

docker compose down docker compose up --build
